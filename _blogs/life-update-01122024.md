# Life Update

Today is January 12th, 2024. I made this blog feature on my website years ago and never used it for whatever reason.

I start college tomorrow, i'll be studying computer science. No real idea of what i'm doing, but i figured finally going and biting that bullet is better than sitting around for another year wishing I had already started. I know it'll be very difficult at times, but as long as <i><strong>I don't drop out</strong></i>, i'll make it out a better person in some way, hopefully many different ways.

That being said, i'm pretty excited to get started. It's probably just me having rose-colored glasses since it's all new to me. I'll try to remember to add an update 'blog' after some time has passed.
