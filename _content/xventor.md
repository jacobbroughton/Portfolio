<p>XVentor is a program that allows potential customers to find the product that would work best for their application in an easy-to-use interface that results in just a few products that would work for them instead of having to sift through 150+ products or contact customer service to find out what they need.</p>

### Task 

<p>My task for this project was to take some of the load off of customer service and allow potential customers of XVentBox to find the product they need in an intuitive user interface and act as a useful guide in navigating the 150+ products that XVentBox offers.</p>

### Technical Details

For this project, I used [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for the front-end, as well as [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management. For the 3D aspect, I used a library called [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) to display product models and let the user interact with them. Local storage is used to maintain the user's dark / light mode preferance through uses of the application. For the backend, I used [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for the server.
