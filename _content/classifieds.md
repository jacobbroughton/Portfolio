<p>This project was my attempt to replicate the functionality / look of the facebook marketplace UI. This includes the ability to add new listings with images, tags, location, condition, etc.. Users can share the listing, as well as change the status of the item (Available, pending, and sold).</p>

### Technical Details

As for technologies / libraries used, this project uses [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for the front-end, [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for routing, and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the backend server. For state, I used the [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html). If i could do it all over again, i'd integrate my own authentication instead of using Auth0, as well as Redux instead of the context API.
