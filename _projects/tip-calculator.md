excerpt: "I was inspired by the tip calculator that google shows and figured I could make my own. Lots of little edge cases to figure out, but overall a great project to work on."

<p>This project was actually built for a youtube tutorial, I do find it to be a pretty interesting app though overall so i figured it could live on my portfolio, I'm proud of how it came out.</p>

### Technical Details

As for the tech that was used, its pretty basic overall. I used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to scaffold a [React](https://reactjs.org/) app and thats pretty much the entire app. Otherwise its just vanilla JS and CSS.
