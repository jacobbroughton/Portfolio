<p>This app was originally going to be a startup. To keep a long story short, i realized a product called Craft existed, which did everything this app was intended to do and way (way) more. So unfortunately, it ended up making the most sense just to walk away from the project and put it here in my portfolio instead. That being said, its far from perfect, but i am very proud of it.</p>
