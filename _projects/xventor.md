<p>XVentor is a program that allows potential customers to find the product that would work best for their application in an easy-to-use interface that results in just a few products that would work for them instead of having to sift through 150+ products or contact customer service to find out what they need.</p>

### Technical Details

For this project, I used [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for the front-end, as well as [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management. Local storage and css variables are used to maintain the user's dark / light mode preferance through uses of the application. For the backend, I used [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for the server runtime, and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for communicating with Node and the Webflow API.
