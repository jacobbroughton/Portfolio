<p>This project is a revamped / updated version of the old Pokedex that I made a while back. This one has new features such as filtering, sorting, searching, and page based pagination. As well as a persistant dark / light mode.</p>

### Technical Details

As for technologies / libraries used, to start, this project was built with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). For the front end, i've used [Next.js](https://www.nextjs.org) (a [React.js](https://www.reactjs.org/) framework) along with the [React Context API](https://www.reactjs.org/docs/context.html) for dealing with state throughout the app. For styling, the app is using [SASS / SCSS](https://sass-lang.org), a CSS preprocessor that lets you use a few different features like nesting (which is rumored to be coming to regular CSS ðŸ‘€).
